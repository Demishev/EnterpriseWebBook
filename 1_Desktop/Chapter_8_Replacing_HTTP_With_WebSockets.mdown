#<a name="ch8">Replacing HTTP with WebSockets</a>
This chapter will introduce the WebSocket API, which is a part of HTML5 spec. We’ll pick one of the data flow in Save a Child site and replace HTTP communication with WebSockets protocol.
Using the monitoring tool we’ll show the performance bandwidth usage benefits that WebSockets protocol brings to the Web.
This chapter will be based on [this WebSockets presentation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vP6MfPnE1c0).
