Many enterprise developers and managers are facing the need to make their applications or Web sites available on the plethora of devices used for accessing Internet, so they need guidance for proper planning Web applications that can be easily ported to the mobile space. This presentation is an overview of different approaches for development of cross-platform Web applications.



This presentation is about planning your next enterprise Web application that should work on desktop computers as well as mobile devices. Many enterprise developers and  managers are facing the need to make their applications or Web sites available on the plethora of devices used for accessing Internet. They need a roadmap for going mobile. One approach is to create separate teams developing desktop and native mobile applications for popular operational environments. This approach can produce good results as long as the IT organization can afford creating and maintaining several versions of the same application.  

But this presentation is about another approach: creation of the cross-platform Web applications using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. This approach has different flavors though. One way is to have the same codebase for both mobile and desktop version (responsive design). Another way is to have two versions of the HTML5 code â€“ one for desktops and the other for mobile devices. If you go with the latter approach, the next question arises: which JavaScript framework to pick so as much of the code will be reused as possible minimizing the learning curve. This presentation is an overview of the entire cycle of the development of a Web application for the desktop first, and eventually moving it to mobile devices.
