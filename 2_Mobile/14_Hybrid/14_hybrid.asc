== Chapter 14. Hybrid Applications: HTML + Native API

Both Web and native applications have their pros and cons. 

While native applications have full access to all hardware of the device (e.g. camera, microphone, et al.), they have drawbacks too. For instance, if you want to publish your application at Apple's App Store you have to submit your application in advance and wait for an approval. If a crucial bug is found in your application, even though if you could fix it in a day, you can't put a new version in production until it went through an approval process. Back in 2011 Financial Times decided to stop using native iOS application because Apple wouldn't share the data about their own subscribers. Don't forget that Apple would get their own cut from each Financial Times subscription. 

On one hand it's good to have an ability to publish your latest Web applications on your own servers without the need to ask for a permission. On the other hand, the presence on Apple's iTunes is a good channel for bringing new customers. The publisher of New York magazine is heavily investing into their native application for iPad but the newer versions of their Web applications are as engaging as their native piers. If you Web application has to be discoverable and visible by search engines, Web application are definitely better.
